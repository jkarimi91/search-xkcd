In conclusion, on examining the above post by CrackMonkey74, after carefully working my way through the haze of spelling errors (documented in section 3), abuse of capitalization (section 4), and general crimes against grammar and syntax (sections 7-8), I have demonstrated that, beneath it all, the work betrays the author's staggering ignorance of the history and the workings of our electoral system.  While the author's wildly swerving train of thought did at one point flirt with coherence, this brief encounter was more likely a chance event (see statistical analysis in table 5) than a result of even rudimentary lucidity.\u000a     -Summer Glau\u000aP.S.

At extreme left, an arrow pointing down and to the left, labeled "To Sun, very very far down". From left to right the gravity wells depicted are: Mercury; Venus; Earth, 5,478 km; Moon, 288 km; Mars, 1,286 km; Ganymede; Io; Jupiter; Europa; Titan, with two small bumps captioned "WEEOOOEEOOOEEEOOO"; Saturn, with its rings depicted as various-colored horizontal bands; Uranus; and Neptune, with a figure exclaiming, "An even more glorious dawn awaits!"\u000a\u000aInset below Earth, the Moon, and Mars are three panels depicting Mars', Deimos's, and Phobos's gravity wells. The Mars inset shows Mars' gravity well, 1,286 km deep, in relation to its moons, Deimos and Phobos, and a NASA Mars Exploration Rover. The Deimos inset shows Deimos' gravity well and a person, labeled "to scale"; the gravity well is approximately two thirds the height of the person, and the caption reads, "You could escape Deimos with a bike and a ramp." The Phobos inset is similar, except that the gravity well is approximately three times the height of the person included for scale, and reads, "A thrown baseball could escape Phobos."\u000a\u000aTo the right of Jupiter's gravity well is a diagram of a well. The height of the well is labeled "very deep"; at the bottom is a figure labeled "your mom"; and three figures, labeled "local football team", are shown falling in head first. Beneath that, the text reads, "Jupiter is not much larger than Saturn, but much more massive. At its size, adding more mass just makes it denser due to the extra squeezing of gravity. If you dropped a few dozen more Jupiters into it, the pressure would ignite fusion and make it a star."\u000a\u000aAt the right of the panel is an inset diagram detailing Earth's gravity well, which is labeled as being 6,379 km deep. Also depicted are the altitudes of low Earth orbit, the ISS, the Space Shuttle, GPS satellites, geosynchronous orbit, and the Moon's gravity well, 288 km deep.

Circuit Diagram {{Title text: I just caught myself idly trying to work out what that resistor mass would actually be, and realized I had self-nerd-sniped.}}\u000a\u000a((A large and complicated circuit diagram.))\u000a\u000a[[In the upper left corner there is a map scale, labeled with 1 mi (1 km).\u000a\u000aUnderneath the scale is an antenna symbol that leads down to a blender, an Arduino; labeled with "Arduino, just for blog cred"; and a chip; "Most expensive chip available".\u000a\u000aTo the right of the antenna there is the symbol for an inductor that has it's lower terminal going into a the left terminal of pattern that looks like a highway cloverleaf.  The upper terminal leads to a line that is going to the upper terminal of that cloverleaf and to a battery symbol (with the + and - symbols on the wrong ends) with a value of â2V.  The right terminal of the cloverleaf is going into a resistor symbol label "120Î© or to taste".  Connected to the other terminals of the resistor and battery is a switch that is labeled "glue open".  The bottom of the two lines has a transistor with two emitters, one P and one N, and no collector.  The P-type emitter is connected to the top line and a jar of scarab beetles.  Above the beetles is a resistor labeled "brown blue orange". To the right is an unlabeled resistor with a center tap going into a capacitor, with a ground on the other end.  Above the capacitor is a diode, and below an inductor.  To the right is another inductor.  The two inductors and ground are all covered by a "solder blob".  The rightmost component is a "666 timer" that has pin 5 going into a question mark.\u000a\u000aBack to the left side, below and to the left of the cloverleaf is a compass rose.  The bottom terminal of the cloverleaf is connected to a battery, labeled 50V, with grounds on both sides.  To the right of the battery is a long horizontal wire that is labeled "pull this wire really tight."  That wire is hooked up to a vertical wire that connects to the N-type emitter of the transistor above it.  To the right is an AC source that is labeled 240V, shorted out, with a label on the short "omit this if you're a wimp."  To the right of that is an inductor that is labeled with "11kg", a batman symbol, and a squirrel.\u000a\u000aBack to the left end of the diagram, where the blender is, there is a wire that is labeled as a distance 3\u000a8" from the wire with the 50V battery.  To the right there is a frowny face, then a vertical wire with a 90 degree bend labeled "caution â±".  That leads into a balloon.  Under the balloon is an inductor symbol with a line on the bottom edge labeled as "warm front".\u000a\u000aUnderneath the blender and to the right of the Arduino is a resistor labeled "ë".  To the right is an electric eel, a capacitor, an unlabeled resistor, and a gob of hot glue attached to a chip with an inverter hooked to an XOR gate, both with feedback into each other.  Under the electric eel is a neck strap.  To the right of the XOR gate and inverter is a bridge rectifier labeled as "Moral rectifier"  to the right again is a bottle of magic smoke, under that a fishing bobber and then a broken wire labeled with a question mark. \u000a\u000aUnder the most expensive chip available there is a vertical wire labeled with "electrons single file".  To the right is a switch labeled "hire someone to open and close switch real fast."  To the right of that is a contact labeled "touche tongue here".  Below that is a resistor labeled "5Î© (decoy)" with only one terminal connected.  To the right of the contact is a methyl group attchaed to a wire.  To the right of the methyl group is a complex mesh of 1Î© resistors labeled with "oh, so you think you're such a whiz at EE201?"\u000a\u000aConnected to the wire labeled "electrons single file" is a wire bent in a U shape with an upside-down ground on the end.  To the right is a flux capacitor with the bottom wire labeled I-95.  To the right of that is a wire labeled yarn, then an arena with two diodes going in and one leaving.  The right diode has a ground on its anode labeled "bury deep, but not too deep."  To the right of that is a motor labeled vibrator, resistor with a value of Ï, and a 500V AC source.\u000a\u000aUnder the flux capacitor is a wire that leads out of frame with a label "â to center of sun".  To the right is a 55 MPH speed limit sign, then an SR latch (flip-flop) labeled "may use an actual sandal instead".  Connected to the Q of the SR latch is a holding pen and to the inverting Q output is a wire in a knot, a resistor labeled "8mm", a resistor symbol labeled "not a resistor; wire just does this", and a motor symbol labeled "to scale".\u000a\u000aUnder the wire that leads off to the center of the sun is a tangled mess of wires connected and jumping over each other, then a photo diode labeled "tear collector".  Under the tear collector is a wire in the shape of a ECG.  To the right is a light bulb, a capacitor-looking symbol labeled 3 liters, a resistor labeled yes, an unlabeled inductor, a resistor with a question mark as a label.  To the right of all that is an inductor labeled "take off shirt while wiring this part.  Ooh, yeah, I like that."  Finally, in the lower right hand corner is a ground symbol immersed in a beaker of holy water.]]

This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.\u000a\u000aA peninsula on the southwest, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the southeast of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the southwest part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.\u000a\u000aThe Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.\u000a\u000aIn the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmvile and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games island, with Eve Online.\u000a\u000aTo the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit, Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages.

Gossip Blogs share an island with Political, Music, and Tech Blogs. To the north of this island is a smaller island called Photo Blogs. South of Diary Blogs, and off the southwest coast of Music blogs is a smaller island called Fandom Blogs. South of Tech Blogs, off of which sprouts the small peninsula of Business Blogs, is the Spamblog Straits.

Map Projections ((The comic is one large panel, with different types of map projections listed in two columns.

In this the world is distorted to fit into a perfect square, centred on Africa.]]\u000aYou're not really into maps.\u000a\u000aRobinson\u000a[[A drawing of the Robinson projection is shown. Areas near the poles in this projection are fairly distorted, but the distortion is greatly reduced when moving toward the equator.]]\u000aYou have a comfortable pair of running shoes that you wear everywhere. You like coffee and enjoy the Beatles. You think the Robinson is the best-looking projection, hands down.\u000a\u000aWinkel-Tripel\u000a[[The Winkel-Tripel projection is similar to the Robinson projection, with less distortion at the poles. However the distortion at equivalent latitudes differs as the longitude varies.]]\u000aNational Geographic adopted the Winkel-Tripel in 1998, but you've been a W-T fan since \u000along\u000a before "Nat Geo" showed up. You're worried it's getting played out, and are thinking of switching to the Kavrayskiy. You once left a party in disgust when a guest showed up wearing shoes with toes. Your favourite musical genre is "post-".\u000a\u000aHobo-Dyer\u000a[[The Hobo-Dyer projection is a cylindrical projection resulting in significant latitudinal distortion. The result is a rectangular image with the poles vertically compressed, and land near the equator stretched.]]\u000aYou want to avoid cultural imperialism but you've heard bad things about Gall-Peters. You're conflict-averse and buy organic.l You use a recently-invented set of gender-neutral pronouns and think that what the world needs is a revolution in consciousness.\u000a\u000aA globe!\u000a[[It's a globe.]]\u000aYes, you're very clever.\u000a\u000aPierce Quincuncial\u000a[[This is a square projection centred over the north pole.

Today is gonna be a good day!\u000a\u000aDymaxion\u000a[[The Dymaxion projection attempts to unfold the earth into a polyhedral net, centred on the north pole. The map has no set shape, instead it looks to be made out of a series of triangles.]]\u000aYou like Isaac Asimov, XML, and shoes with toes. You think the segway got a bad rap. You own 3D goggles, which you use to view rotating models of better 3D goggles. You type in Dvorak.\u000a\u000aGoode Homolosine\u000a[[The Goode Homolosine projection attempts to minimise distortion by combining two equal area projections onto a split projection. The map resembles a smooth unfolded net, with landmasses kept whole where possible.]]\u000aThey say mapping the earth on a 2D surface is like flattening an orange peel, which seems easy enough to you. You like easy solutions. You think we wouldn't have so many problems if we'd just elect \u000anormal\u000a people to congress instead of politicians.

You like how \u000ax\u000a and \u000ay\u000a map to latitude and longitude. The other projections overcomplicate things. You want me to stop asking about maps so you can enjoy dinner.\u000a\u000aWaterman Butterfly\u000a[[This projection unfolds the world into a net, similar to the Dymaxion projection. It is centred on the Atlantic, and resembles a butterfly with the Americas on the western wing, with Europe and Africa on the eastern wing.]]\u000aReally? You know the Waterman?

Ablogalypse [[A line graph with four lines, each representing 'Google Trends Search Volume' of different search terms over time from prior to 2005 to just after 2012. A blue line represents "blog," which trends gradually but significantly upwards from well before 2005 until it reaches a peak between 2008-2009, and starts to very slowly descend to today. A red line represents "Tumblr", which is at zero until it slowly starts to trend upward in early 2010, and then sharply increases in late 2010 and through 2011 and 2012. As of the date of this comic, 'blog' still beats 'Tumblr' in terms of search volume, but a dotted line projection of the trend shows that on October 12, 2012, the two lines will cross.  A yellow line represents 'Wordpress,' which has very low volume until a very small and gradual increase in 2007, which gradually increases to this day but doesn't come close to meeting the volume of either 'blog' or 'Tumblr'. A green line represents 'LiveJournal,' which started out prior to 2005 at around the level 'Wordpress' is at now, but declined through 2005 and 2006 until it has plateaued until virtually nothing.]]\u000aIn about six months, the word "Tumblr" will eclipse "blog" in Google popularity.

VThe average error in the NHC forecasted position of a hurricane three days in the future has shrunk to a third of what it was in 1990--a staggering accomplishment. However, as you may have gathered, forecasts of future storm *strength* have proved more difficult to improve. Epsilon and Zeta THE SAGA OF EPSILON AND ZETA\u000aThe 2005 Atlantic hurricane season saw devastating storms like Katrina and Rita. But less well-remembered is just how \u000astrange\u000a the season got toward the end.\u000aThe forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are the best of the best.\u000aTheir predictions are masterpieces of professional analysis. But in November 2005, out in the center of the Atlantic - far from any land - the atmosphere stopped making sense.\u000aAnd the forecasters - who'd expected the season to be long over by now - started to get a little unhinged.\u000aThis is their story, as seen through the actual 2005 NHC Advisories:\u000a\u000a[[Two men, one bald and one not, sit looking at their respective computers, at separate desks, back to back. The advisory is printed above them in caps\u000asmall-caps Courier type.]]\u000aTuesday, November 29th, 2005: \u000aTropical Storm Epsilon . . .\u000aThe 26th named storm of the apparently never ending 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.\u000a\u000a[[The same scene, different text.]]\u000a10 PM Wed: The window of opportunity for strengthening should close in 12-24 hr.\u000a4 PM Thu: Slow but steady weakening is expected to begin in 12-24 hours.\u000a\u000a[[The man with hair now has questions marks above his head.]]\u000a4 AM Fri: Epsilon does not appear weaker.\u000a10 AM Fri: Epsilon has been upgraded to a 65-kt hurricane.\u000a\u000a[[The two still sit back-to-back.]]\u000a4 PM Sat: Epsilon has continued to strengthen against all odds . . . [but] can not maintain the current intensity much longer since the environment is becoming increasingly unfavorable.\u000a\u000a[[Ditto.]]\u000a10 PM Sat: Epsilon might or might not still be a hurricane . . . but in any case it likely will not be one on Sunday.\u000a4 AM Sun: Epsilon is downgraded to a tropical storm. \u000a\u000a[[Yep.]]\u000a10 AM Sun: Morning satellite images indicate that Epsilon has restrengthened.\u000a\u000a[[A closer view of just the balding man at his desk.]]\u000aThere are no clear reasons . . . and I am not going to make one up . . . to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon and I am just describing the facts.\u000aHowever . . . I still have to make an intensity forecast and the best bet at this time is to predict weakening . . . Epsilon will likely become a remnant low.\u000aI heard that before about epsilon . . . haven't you?\u000a\u000a[[The two men still sit back to back, but the man with hair is now turning his head toward the other man, with his arm resting on the back of his chair.

I thought I was going to find a weakening system and instead I found that Epsilon is still a hurricane.\u000a\u000a[[Ditto.]]\u000a10 AM  Thu: Convection has vanished and Epsilon is now a tight swirl of low clouds.\u000aI hope this is the end of the long lasting 2005 hurricane season.\u000a\u000a[[This panel is blank and just reads: Nope.]]\u000a\u000aEnter Tropical Storm Zeta.\u000a[[The men are still at their desks.

I ran out of things to say.\u000a\u000a[[And again.]]\u000a4 AM Thu: Satellite intensity estimates have decreased.

V'Unfortunately, the notion of marriage which prevails ... at the present time ... regards the institution as simply a convenient arrangement or formal contract ... This disregard of the sanctity of marriage and contempt for its restrictions is one of the most alarming tendencies of the present age.' --John Harvey Kellogg, Ladies' guide in health and disease (1883) The Pace of Modern Life ((This strip is in the form of a long series of quotes. Here, each quote is given as a separate panel. Attribution is delimited with a --. Some text is bolded; it is enclosed in asterisks.))\u000a*The art of letter-writing is fast dying out.* When a letter cost nine pence, it seemed but fair to try to make it worth nine pence... Now, however, we think we are too busy for such old-fashioned correspondence. *We fire off a multitude of rapid and short notes, instead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet of paper.*\u000a-- The Sunday Magazine\u000a1871\u000a\u000aIt is, unfortunately, one of the chief characteristics of modern business to be always in a hurry. *In olden times it was different.*\u000a-- The Medical Record\u000a1884\u000a\u000aWith the advent of cheap newspapers and superior means of locomotion... the dreamy quiet old days are over... for *men now live think and work at express speed.* They have their \u000aMercury\u000a or \u000aPost\u000a laid on their breakfast table in the early morning, and if they are too hurried to snatch from it the news during that meal, they carry it off, to be *sulkily read as they travel... leaving them no time to talk with the friend who may share the compartment with them*... the hurry and bustle of modern life... lacks the quiet and repose of the period when our forefathers, the day's work done, took their ease...\u000a-- William Smith, Morley: Ancient and Modern\u000a1886\u000a\u000aConversation is said to be a lost art... good talk presupposes leisure, both for preparation and enjoyment. *The age of leisure is dead, and the art of conversation is dying.*\u000a-- Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, volume 29\u000a1890\u000a\u000aIntellectual laziness and the hurry of the age have produced *a craving for literary nips*. The torpid brain... has grown too weak for sustained thought. \u000a*There never was an age in which so many people were able to write badly*. \u000a-- Israel Zangwill, The Bachelors' Club\u000a1891\u000a\u000a*The art of pure line engraving is dying out. We live at too fast a rate* to allow for the preparation of such plates as our fathers appreciated. If a picture catches the public fancy, the public must have an etched or a photogravured copy of it within a month or two of its appearance. The days when engravers were wont to spend two or three years over a single plate are for ever gone. \u000a-- Journal of the Institute of Jamaica, volume 1\u000a1892\u000a\u000aSo much is exhibited to the eye that *nothing is left to the imagination*. It seems almost possible that the modern world might be choked by its own riches, *and human faculty dwindle away amid the million inventions that ahve been introduced to render its exercise unnecessary*.\u000aThe articles in the quarterlies extend to thirty or more pages, but *thirty pages is now too much*. So we witness a further condensing process and, we have the \u000afortnightly\u000a and the \u000acontemporary\u000a which reduce thirty pages to *fifteen pages* so that you may read a larger number of articles in a shorter time and in a shorter form. As if this last condensing process were not enough the condensed articles of these periodicals are *further condensed* by the daily papers, which will give you *a summary of the summary* of that which has been written about everything. \u000a*Those who are dipping into so many subjects and gathering information in a summary and superficial form lose the habit of settling down to great works*. \u000aEphemeral literature is driving out the great classics of the present and the past... *hurried reading can never be good reading*. \u000a-- G. J. Goschen, First annual address to the students, Toynbee Hall, London\u000a1894\u000a\u000aThe existence of *mental and nervous degeneration among a growing class of people*, especially in large cities, is an obvious phenomenon... the mania for stimulants... diseases of the mind are almost as numerous as the diseases of the body... this intellectual condition is characterized by *a brain incapable of normal working... in a large measure due to the hurry and excitement of modern life*. with its facilities for rapid locomotion and almost instantaneous communication between remote points of the globe*...\u000a-- The Churchman, volume 71\u000a1895\u000a\u000aIf we *teach the children how to play* and encourage them in their sports... *instead of shutting them in badly ventilated schoolrooms*, the next generation will be more joyous and will be heailthier than the present one. \u000a-- Public Opinion: A Comprehensive Summary of the Press Throughout the World, volume 18\u000a1895\u000a\u000aThe cuase of the... increase in nervous disease is *increased demand made by the coditions of modern life upon the brain*. Everything is done in a hurry. *We talk across a continent, telegraph across an ocean*, take a trip to Chicago for an hour's talk... *We even take our pleasures sadly and make a task of our play*... What wonder if the pressure is almost more than our nerves can bear. \u000a-- G. Shrady (from P. C. Knapp) "Are nervous diseases increasing?" Medical Record\u000a1896\u000a\u000a*The managers of sensational newspapers*... do not try to educate their readers and make them better, but tend to *create perverted tastes and develop vicious tendencies*. The owners of these papers seem to have but one purpose, and that is to increase their circulation.\u000a-- Medical Brief, volume 26\u000a1898\u000a\u000a*To take sufficient time for our meals seems frequently impossible* on account of the demands on our time made by our business... we act on the apparent belief that all of our business is so pressing that we must jump on the quickest car home, eat our dinner in the most hurried way, make the closest connection for car returning... \u000a-- Louis John Rettger, Studies in Advanced Physiology\u000a1898\u000a\u000aIn these days of increasing rapid artificial locomotion, *may I be permitted to say a word in favour of a very worthy and valuable old friend of mine, Mr Long Walk?*\u000a*I am afraid that this good gentleman is in danger of getting neglected, if not forgotten*. We live in days of water trips and land trips, excursions by sea, road and rail- bicycles and tricycles, tram cars and motor cars... but in my humble opinion, good honest walking exercise for health beats all other kinds of locomotion into a cocked hat. \u000a-- T. Thatcher, "A plea for a long walk", The Publishers' Circular\u000a1902\u000a\u000aThe art of conversation is almost a lost one. *People talk as they ride bicycles - at a rush - without pausing to consider their surroundings*... What has been generally understood as cultured society is rapidly deteriorating into baseness and voluntary ignorance. *The profession of letters is so little understood*, and so far from being seriously appreciated, that... newspapers are full, not of thoughtful honestly expressed public opinion on the affairs of the nation, but of vapid personalities interesting to none save gossips and busy bodies. \u000a-- Marie Corelli, Free Opinions, Freely Expressed\u000a1905\u000a\u000aThere is a great *tendency among the children of today to rebel against restraint*, not only that placed upon them by the will of the parent, but against any restraint or limitation of what they consider their rights... this fact has filled well minded people with great apprehensions for the future. \u000a-- Rev. Henry Hussmann, The Authority of Parents\u000a1906\u000a\u000a*Our modern family gathering, silent* around the fire, *each individual with his head buried in his favourite magazine*, is the somewhat natural outcome of the banishment of colloquy from the school...\u000a-- The Journal of Education, volume 29\u000a1907\u000a\u000aPlays in theatres at the present time present spectacles and *deal openly with situations which no person would have dared to mention in general society forty years ago*... The current representations of *nude men and women in the daily journals* and the illustrated magazines would have excluded such periodicals from all respectable families two decades ago... Those who have been divorced... forty and fifty years ago lost at once and irrevocably their standing in society, while to-day they continue in all their social relationships, hardly changed...\u000a-- Editorial, The Watchman, Boston\u000a1908\u000a\u000aWe write millions more letters than did our grandfathers, but the increase in volume has brought with it an automatic artificial machine-like ring... an examination of a file of old letters reveals not only a remarkable grasp of details, but a *fitness and courtliness too often totally lacking* in the mechanical curt cut and dried letters of to-day. \u000a-- Forrest Crissey, Handbook of Modern Business Correspondence\u000a1908\u000a\u000a*A hundred years ago it took so long and cost so much to send a latter that it seemed worth while to put some time and thought into writing it*. Now the quickness and the cheapness of the post seem to justify the feeling that *a brief letter to-day may be followed by another next week - a "line" now by another to-morrow*. \u000a-- Percy Holmes Boynton, Principles of Composition \u000a1915\u000a\u000a{{Title text: 'Unfortunately, the notion of marriage which prevails ... at the present time ... regards the institution as simply a convenient arrangement or formal contract ...
